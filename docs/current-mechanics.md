# Current Mechanics

**Document status:** Current prototype mechanics reference  
**Document created:** 2026-05-28

**Source:** ChatGPT project notes and current Roblox Studio implementation discussions  
**Current status:** Active index / source-of-truth summary  

## Codex Usage Rule

When using this document with Codex:

- Treat the newest `Last updated` date as the most reliable version of each system.
- Only edit files related to the system being requested.
- Do not rewrite unrelated systems.
- Do not replace newer files with older logic unless explicitly requested.
- If a script/folder name is marked `TBC`, inspect the Roblox project or ask for the latest hierarchy before renaming files.
- Prefer small targeted changes over large rewrites.
- Preserve existing working behaviour unless the task specifically asks to replace it.

## Known Project-Wide Issues

**Created / first designed:** 2026-05-28  
**Last updated:** 2026-05-28  
**Current status:** Active checklist  
**Relevant docs file:** `docs/current-mechanics.md`

- Some exact script/folder names still need recording from Roblox Studio.
- Night mode currently has a day skybox issue, last discussed 2026-05-26.
- LOD4 foliage visibility previously behaved incorrectly, last discussed 2026-04-29.
- Traffic light script needed adjustment to match the actual hierarchy, last discussed 2026-04-29.
- Draw calls can spike when moving or rotating the camera, last discussed 2026-05-12.
- Mobile testing is still needed.
- Published-client testing is still needed.
- Some existing systems are implemented but not yet documented in GitHub.

## Confirmed Working Across The Project

- Vehicle driving mechanics exist.
- Driver seat position keeper runs.
- Open-world city exists.
- LOD system exists.
- Far LOD5 system exists.
- Lighting preset workflow exists.
- Day lighting values have been captured.
- UI exists.
- Customisation exists.
- Traffic light behaviour has been designed.
- The project direction is clear: playable futuristic hover-racing prototype for funding.

## Still Needs Testing Across The Project

- Full gameplay loop from spawn to race completion.
- Multiplayer.
- Mobile.
- Published client.
- StreamingEnabled edge cases.
- Save/load if used.
- Performance over long play sessions.
- Race route readability.
- Vehicle stability at high speed.
- Lighting changes in live gameplay.
- LOD transitions during fast driving.

## Codex Safety Notes

- Do not use this index as permission to rewrite multiple systems at once.
- When a task targets one system, read that system doc first and edit only related docs or code.
- If a future task needs code changes, update the relevant docs after the implementation is confirmed in Studio.
