# Neo Tokyo Racers Project Context

Last updated: 2026-06-03

## Current Project

Neo Tokyo Racers is a Roblox open-world hover racing game with modular hovercars. The main vehicle category currently being built is `BRUISER`.

The vehicle system is category-based: cockpits and modules inside the same category share fixed slot locations, so modules can be swapped between similar cockpits.

## Current Script State

Known from chat:

- Architecture migration Phases 15-21 were committed after successful testing. Main client extraction Phase A-E later removed the final active legacy-named `HOVER_RACING` owner from live use.
- Main client extraction Phase A-E has passed. Phase D switched the active main client owner to `StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts.NeoTokyoRacersClient.NeoTokyoRacersClient_Bootstrap_Shadow_Disabled`; Phase E audit passed cleanly with no active legacy-named `HOVER_RACING` scripts. The old `HOVER_RACING_V2_Client` is disabled and kept as rollback.
- Architecture Phase K completed successfully on 2026-05-29 at 17:31:59 in Studio: `ReplicatedStorage.HOVER_RACING_V2_KIT` contents moved into `ReplicatedStorage.NeoTokyoRacers`, 20 source objects patched, 112 replacements applied, and final legacy source hits were 0.
- Architecture Phase L completed successfully on 2026-05-29 at 17:35:09 in Studio: migrated folders were present, legacy source/ObjectValue references were 0, and `ReplicatedStorage.HOVER_RACING_V2_KIT` no longer exists.
- Architecture Phase N completed successfully on 2026-05-29 at 18:36:09 in Studio: 10 source objects patched, 24 replacements applied, stale ObjectValues repaired, `Workspace.NeoTokyoRacersWorld.SpawnPoints.VehicleSpawnPoint` created, and final old runtime source hits were 0.
- World Phase F is prepared to move city blocks from `Workspace.GeneratedCityBlocks` into `Workspace.NeoTokyoRacersWorld.City.Block S#` and patch the active LOD client root resolver.
- World Phase J is prepared to move `ReplicatedStorage.FarLOD5` into `ReplicatedStorage.NeoTokyoRacers.Assets.World.FarLOD5Proxies` and patch the active LOD client far-proxy resolver.
- Cleanup Phase G is a read-only full hierarchy audit for identifying old inactive folders, disabled legacy scripts, rollback scripts, and report folders before any deletion script is generated.
- Cleanup Phase H is the targeted deletion phase for Phase G's confirmed inactive legacy items. It must be run in `DRY_RUN` first, then `DELETE` only after reviewing the exact path list.
- Cleanup Phase I is an aggressive one-step migration clutter cleanup. It deletes stale reports, reference ObjectValues, mirror-only generated config, non-live scaffold/shadow/snapshot code, and empty placeholder folders after confirming active owners are healthy.
- Cleanup Phase M is a post-K/L read-only audit for stale legacy kit references, empty compatibility folders, old reports, nil ObjectValues, and remaining cleanup candidates after `HOVER_RACING_V2_KIT` removal.
- Cleanup Phase O completed successfully. Final Phase M verification at 2026-05-29 18:55:53 showed 0 warnings, 0 missing required paths, 0 source legacy hits, 0 stale ObjectValues, 0 auto cleanup candidates, and 0 review-before-delete candidates.
- Architecture Phase P is present in the Git repo as the conservative first garage runtime startup repair, but it is superseded by Phase Q if the line 23 garage controller error remains.
- Architecture Phase Q repaired the post-Phase-N/P garage startup regression where `GarageActionController_Shadow_Disabled` errors near line 23 and the garage UI does not load. The user reported Phase Q worked.
- Lighting Phase R is prepared to repair `Fogcolor` typo warnings by changing lighting presets to Roblox's valid `FogColor` property and adding a compatibility alias in `LightingService_Active`.
- Vehicle Phase AI removes/deprioritises the cockpit car-light experiments from Phases S through AH. No cockpit SpotLight, Beam, smoother, projector, or diagnostic runtime should be considered current. Ordinary cosmetic neon colour channels remain.
- Dealership Intro Phases 1-7 were installed and confirmed working by the user on 2026-06-03. The flow now uses editable dealership markers, opens the full garage only at `GarageDeskTrigger`, delays the local preview until cockpit purchase/select succeeds, restores preview orbit camera behavior, spawns the final drivable vehicle from `VehicleExitSpawnPoint`, and includes an Exit button that only reopens after the player leaves and re-enters the desk zone.
- Phase 15 successfully moved live server action ownership to `ServerScriptService.NeoTokyoRacers.Services.Garage.GarageActionController_Shadow_Disabled`. The old `HOVER_RACING_V2_Server` remains available for rollback but is no longer the live server action owner.
- `V74` restored the pre-V72/default Roblox driving camera feel and added a light camera assist. The user confirmed this worked well.
- `V75` was generated next to add boost recharge delay and low-speed hover wobble. At the time of writing, no later user confirmation is present in this chat history.

Recommended baseline:

- Server action owner baseline: `GarageActionController_Shadow_Disabled` is currently the tested live owner after Phase 15.
- Dealership intro baseline: Phases 1-7 are the current tested startup/customisation flow. Use `docs/dealership-intro-flow-2026-06-03.md` before changing garage startup, preview timing, desk open behavior, or final vehicle spawn placement.
- Use `scripts/roblox_hover_racing_v74_pre_v72_camera_assist.lua` if camera stability is the priority.
- Use `scripts/roblox_hover_racing_v75_boost_delay_hover_wobble.lua` as the latest generated patch, then play-test fresh in Roblox Studio.

## Important Working Style

- Prefer small command-bar scripts that modify one system at a time.
- Do not create in-game backup copies unless explicitly asked. Roblox version history is the preferred backup.
- Avoid large fragile patches against the main client script when a ModuleScript replacement or config folder can solve it.
- If a patch depends on a specific older script shape and may fail, say that before writing the script.
