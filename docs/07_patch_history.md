# Patch History

This is a high-level summary, not a complete changelog of every script.

## Documentation

- 2026-05-28: Added dated current mechanics docs covering vehicle, lighting, LOD, traffic lights, mobile performance, customisation, UI, race events, and open-world city systems. These docs are a reference layer for future Codex/ChatGPT sessions and should not be treated as permission to rewrite unrelated systems.
- 2026-05-29: Added Architecture Phase K command-bar migration plan/script to move `ReplicatedStorage.HOVER_RACING_V2_KIT` into `ReplicatedStorage.NeoTokyoRacers` domains with guarded source preflight.
- 2026-05-29: Updated Architecture Phase K preflight patching for registry/path-string source references to `00_EDIT_ME_FIRST` and `UI_THEME_DoNotRename`.
- 2026-05-29: Added Architecture Phase L command-bar deletion gate to verify no live dependencies remain, then destroy `ReplicatedStorage.HOVER_RACING_V2_KIT`.
- 2026-05-29: Confirmed Architecture Phase K and Phase L completed in Studio. The old `ReplicatedStorage.HOVER_RACING_V2_KIT` root is gone, with 0 legacy source hits and 0 legacy ObjectValue references in the Phase L report.
- 2026-05-28: Added target architecture reorganisation plan and Studio inventory report script for planning a safe future hierarchy migration.
- 2026-05-28: Added a dedicated Studio inventory report paste document for long Roblox Explorer hierarchy reports.
- 2026-05-28: Added hierarchy migration plan based on the pasted Studio inventory, with `Test + WIP Assets` explicitly excluded from migration.
- 2026-05-28: Added `scripts/roblox_hierarchy_phase1_architecture_resolver.lua`, a non-destructive Studio command-bar script that creates future `NeoTokyoRacers` architecture roots, adds a compatibility `PathResolver`, and mirrors key config folders without moving live systems.
- 2026-05-28: Added `scripts/roblox_hierarchy_phase2_live_references_registry.lua`, a non-destructive Studio command-bar script that adds visual ObjectValue references to current live systems and a `LiveSystemRegistry` bridge module for future targeted migrations.
- 2026-05-28: Added `scripts/roblox_studio_active_script_audit_v1.lua`, a read-only Studio command-bar audit that reports active scripts outside approved live roots and flags generic, temporary, WIP/test, and excluded-area scripts.
- 2026-05-28: Added `scripts/roblox_studio_suspicious_script_inspector_v1.lua`, a read-only Studio command-bar inspector that captures source previews, line counts, fingerprints, and keyword hints for unexpected/generic active scripts before any cleanup decisions.
- 2026-05-28: User manually removed two generic active `LocalScript`s from `StarterPlayerScripts`; `TEMP_LightingPreview` is intentionally kept as a day/night lighting preview tool.
- 2026-05-28: Updated audit/inspector scripts so `TEMP_LightingPreview` is treated as an intentional temporary lighting tool rather than accidental clutter.
- 2026-05-28: Added `scripts/roblox_studio_archive_disabled_legacy_scripts_v1.lua`, a cleanup script that archives disabled legacy `HOVER_RACING*` scripts into `ServerStorage.NeoTokyoRacers_LegacyArchive.DisabledScripts` without deleting them or touching active systems.
- 2026-05-28: Added `scripts/roblox_hierarchy_phase3_config_registry_mirrors.lua`, a non-destructive config migration script that creates/refines `NeoTokyoRacers.Shared.Config`, adds live config references, refreshes generated config mirrors, and installs `ConfigRegistry` without changing live config values or switching live scripts.
- 2026-05-28: Added a lightweight Studio-to-GitHub script source mirror workflow: `scripts/roblox_studio_export_scripts_for_github_v1.lua`, `scripts/import_studio_script_export.py`, `docs/10_script_source_sync_workflow.md`, and `roblox/exported_scripts/`.
- 2026-05-28: Imported the current Studio script export into `roblox/exported_scripts` and added `docs/11_manual_script_copy_map.md` for manual source copy guidance.
- 2026-05-28: Reviewed the exported Studio script mirror and added `docs/script-architecture-review-2026-05-28.md`, documenting the current client/server modularity risks, mobile performance priorities, and staged migration order.
- 2026-05-28: Added `scripts/roblox_hierarchy_phase4_architecture_staging_scaffold.lua`, a non-destructive Studio command-bar script that creates future service/controller/config folders and ObjectValue references without moving or changing live scripts.

- 2026-05-28: Added `docs/phase13-server-parity-harness-2026-05-28.md` and `scripts/roblox_hierarchy_phase13_server_parity_harness.lua`, a non-destructive parity gate that compares the live V56 hash against the Phase 12 snapshot and optionally checks the `GetInitial` response shape in Play mode.
- 2026-05-28: Corrected Phase 12 snapshot generation so `V56ActionLayerSnapshot` is valid Lua, updated Phase 13 to avoid unsupported server-side `OnServerInvoke` reads, and added `scripts/roblox_hierarchy_phase13b_client_getinitial_shape_check.lua` for the client-side `GetInitial` shape check.

## Early System

- Initial command-bar scripts created starter folders, template parts, module categories, UI, money, and a short checkpoint race.
- The system moved from cable-tied modular slots to fixed category-based module slots.

## Fixed-Slot Category System

- `V13` and later scripts introduced a fixed-slot category system.
- `BRUISER` became the active vehicle category.
- Modules became interchangeable within a vehicle category.

## UI and Mobile

- Multiple responsive/futuristic UI patches refined the dealership, module selection, colour picker, customisation menus, and mobile controls.
- The UI settled toward dark translucent panels, light green borders, and futuristic text.

## VFX

- V23-V31 introduced VFX templates for hover dust, engine jets, boost, stabilisers, and custom VFX hierarchies.
- V64-V66 added cached thrust visual runtime and fixed a weld leak.

## Server/Action Layer Recovery

- V52-V56 rebuilt or repaired server/action logic after earlier patch failures.
- Later guidance: avoid large brittle server/client rewrites unless necessary.
- 2026-06-02: Added `scripts/roblox_architecture_phaseP_garage_runtime_startup_repair.lua` in the Git repo for the conservative post-Phase-N garage runtime startup repair. Phase Q supersedes it if the line 23 startup error remains.
- 2026-06-02: Added `scripts/roblox_architecture_phaseQ_garage_controller_header_repair.lua` to repair a post-Phase-N/P startup failure in the active garage action controller by replacing only the V56 startup header with migrated NeoTokyoRacers paths.

## Lighting

- 2026-06-02: Added `scripts/roblox_lighting_phaseR_fogcolor_property_repair.lua` to fix the invalid `Fogcolor` preset key by changing it to Roblox's valid `FogColor` property and adding a compatibility alias in `LightingService_Active`.

## Vehicle Assets

- 2026-06-02: Experimented with cockpit car-light phases S through AH, covering native SpotLights, local projectors, root-only emitters, predictive hosts, and Beam visuals. These did not meet the desired quality bar at speed.
- 2026-06-03: Removed the cockpit car-light experiment scripts/docs from the active repo and added `scripts/roblox_vehicle_phaseAI_remove_cockpit_light_systems.lua` to remove installed helper scripts, light assets, root SpotLights, Beam/projector artifacts, and stale cockpit-light attributes from Studio. Front/rear long-range car lights are deferred.

## Driving

- V62 restored V47-style driving and replaced fallback driving paths with `DrivingControllerV47`.
- V67-V71 restored and corrected mobile driving HUD visibility.
- V72/V73 experimented with a fully scriptable chase camera but caused jitter and did not feel right.
- V74 restored the pre-V72/default Roblox camera feel with a light camera assist. User confirmed this worked well.
- V75 added boost recharge delay, editable boost module attributes, and low-speed hover wobble. Needs play-test confirmation unless confirmed later.

## Current Important Scripts

- `scripts/roblox_hover_racing_v74_pre_v72_camera_assist.lua`
- `scripts/roblox_hover_racing_v75_boost_delay_hover_wobble.lua`
- `scripts/roblox_architecture_phaseP_garage_runtime_startup_repair.lua`
- `scripts/roblox_architecture_phaseQ_garage_controller_header_repair.lua`
- `scripts/roblox_lighting_phaseR_fogcolor_property_repair.lua`
- Cockpit light removal/defer script: `scripts/roblox_vehicle_phaseAI_remove_cockpit_light_systems.lua`
- No cockpit car-light renderer is current after Phase AI.
