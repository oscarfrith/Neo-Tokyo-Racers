# VFX System

## Current Direction

The VFX system is intended to support:

- Engine idle flame/VFX.
- Engine acceleration flame/VFX.
- Boost VFX.
- Stabiliser/drift VFX.
- Hover dust under the cockpit.

The user moved away from generic smoke-style effects toward sharper rocket/jet style effects.

## Engine VFX

Known hierarchy from chat:

```text
EngineJet
  Settings
  EngineOff_Host
    TemplateAttachmentLong
      EngineOff_Fire
    TemplateAttachmentShort
      EngineOff_BeamFlame
    TemplateBeamEndShort
  TemplateHost_Invisible
    TemplateAttachmentLong
      EngineOn_BeamFlame
      EngineOn_BeamFlame
      EngineOn_BeamFlame
      EngineOn_BeamInner
      EngineOn_BeamOuter
      EngineOn_Fire
    TemplateAttachmentShort
    TemplateBeamEndLong
    TemplateBeamEndMid
    TemplateBeamEndShort
```

Known intended behaviour:

- `EngineOff_Fire` plays while driving and not accelerating.
- Engine on VFX plays while accelerating.
- `EngineOff_Fire` should disable while accelerating.

## Boost VFX

Known intended behaviour:

- Boost VFX only turns on while boost is held/active.
- Boost VFX particles should take the selected thrust colour.
- Beams can remain white unless explicitly changed later.

## Stabiliser VFX

Known intended behaviour:

- Left stabiliser VFX turns on when drifting left.
- Right stabiliser VFX turns on when drifting right.
- Not both at once unless both sides are intentionally active in a future design.

## Thrust Colour

Thrust colour applies to:

- Engine particles/fire.
- Boost particles/fire.
- Stabiliser particles/fire.
- `THRUST_COLOR_WhiteByDefault` module assets.

Known particle names to recolour:

- `BoostOn_Fire`
- `EngineOff_Fire`
- `EngineOn_Fire`
- `StabiliserOn_Fire`

Known rule:

- Beam effects can stay white.
- Cosmetic optional neon should not be changed by thrust colour.

## Performance Notes

Known performance choices:

- Cached VFX runtime was added to avoid repeated cloning.
- A weld leak in cached thrust visuals was fixed in V66.
- Particle rates should stay moderate on mobile.
- Beams are generally efficient, but lots of animated textures/particles across many cars still need profiling.
